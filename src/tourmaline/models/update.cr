    # The update‘s unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain
    # positive number and increase sequentially. This ID becomes especially

    # repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence,
    # should they get out of order. If there are no new updates
    # for at least a week, then identifier of the next update
    # will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.
